Dear Hiring Manager:

I'm writing in reference to the iOS Software Engineer opening at The Browser Company.
The Arc browser has been not only my preferred browser, but the only web browser I've used on Mac since the waitlist days, and on iOS, I use Arc Search every day.
I've been considering moving jobs to work on a product that I'm enthusiastic about and would enjoy contributing to, and so I was thrilled to see that The Browser Company is hiring iOS engineers, as this is my field of speciality.
Reading through the job posting and exploring your company's content has made me even more excited about this opportunity.
The technology seems familiar enough that I hope to be able to contribute value immediately, and yet challenging and interesting; 
I've only dabbled in The Composable Architecture so far and would love to use it in a production-scale application, and developing in C++ would be a great way to dig beneath the surface of the familiar Apple SDKs.
The team seems wonderful and energetic, and the company as a whole seems like a great place to work.

I hope my accompanying resume will win me your consideration for the role, but in short, I believe I could be a valuable addition to the team for a few reasons. 
With 8 years of experience in iOS engineering, I've developed a deep love for Swift to the point where I've followed its development on the Swift Evolution blog and forum to understand some of the language design choices.
I enjoy developing innovative products that make users' lives easier, and have used my position as a mobile developer in an agile startup to suggest interface solutions to tricky problems.
On said startup project, I also stuck around long enough to see the long-term impact of my software design choices, and to appreciate the value of robust code that reduces defects and increases customer satisfaction.
I also love technical mentorship, and have not just coached the junior members on all the teams I've been on, but also chaired an internal committee at my current company with the express purpose of facilitating knowledge sharing and continuous learning.

You may be concerned about my location, as I am applying from South Africa. With regards to my timezone, I am very comfortable adjusting my work hours to ensure I have enough overlap with any team members. And with regards to infrastructure, while South Africa has famously been suffering rolling blackouts for over a decade, I am personally protected against power outages by having a self-sufficient solar power solution.

To summarize, <!-- TODO: Reiterate interest in position and enthusiasm to use my skills to contrinute to the work of the organisation. Thank the reader for their consideration of my application. State that I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss the position. Example below:
I admire the work done by the Wikimedia Foundation and would be thrilled to have the opportunity to use my skills to contribute to your work. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to hearing back and further discuss the position.
-->

Sincerely,

Phlippie Bosman
