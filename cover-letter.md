Dear Hiring Manager:

I'm writing in reference to the iOS Software Engineer opening at the Wikimedia Foundation. I find the Wikipedia iOS app a joy to use, and so I was thrilled to discover that the organisation behind it are hiring from my own field. It would be a pleasure to contribute to a software product of such high quality, and to be able to learn from it. Additionally, I was drawn to apply for this role for these reasons: there seem to be interesting challenges, such as extensive localization and highly dynamic content; I admire that the project is open source; and I would love to experience working in an effective, large, remote team.

I hope my accompanying resume will win me your consideration for the role, but in short, I believe I could be a valuable addition to the team for a number of reasons. I have eight years of experience with iOS programming in Swift and Objective C. I have worked on large and complexes codebases within complex organizations, taking applications from inception to production, and providing hands-on end-user support and bug fixing. The teams I've worked with in the last 5 years had a mixed-remote makeup, with some members residing in other countries. Lastly, as a South African, I might be able to offer a fresh perspective in terms of tolerance to and performance under conditions of low bandwidth and frequent network outages, which I think could improve the experience for all users.

To summarize, I admire the work done by the Wikimedia Foundation and would be thrilled to have the opportunity to use my skills to contribute to your work. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to hear back and further discuss the position.

Sincerely,

Phlippie Bosman
