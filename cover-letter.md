Dear Hiring Manager:

I'm writing in reference to the iOS Software Engineer opening at The Browser Company.
The Arc browser has been not only my preferred browser, but the only web browser I've used on Mac since the waitlist days, and on iOS, Arc Search is one of the four apps on my dock.
I've been considering moving jobs to work on a modern product that I'm enthusiastic about and would enjoy contributing to, and so I was thrilled to see that The Browser Company is hiring iOS engineers.
Reading through the job posting and exploring your company's content has made me even more excited about this opportunity.
The technology is familiar enough that I could contribute value immediately, and yet challenging and interesting; 
I've only dabbled in The Composable Architecture so far and would love to use it in a production-scale application, and developing in C++ would be a great way to dig beneath the surface of the familiar Apple SDKs.
The team seems wonderful and energetic, and the company as a whole seems like a place where I would fit in and get along.

I hope my accompanying resume will win me your consideration for the role, but in short, I believe I'd be a great addition to the team for a few reasons. 
With over 8 years of experience in iOS engineering, I've developed a deep love for Swift, going as far as following its development on the Swift Evolution blog and forums to understand some of the language design choices and upcoming features.
I enjoy developing innovative products that make users' lives easier, and have used my position as a mobile developer in an agile startup to introduce intuitive interface solutions to tricky problems.
On said startup project, I also stuck around long enough to see the long-term impact of my software design choices, and to appreciate the value of robust code that reduces defects and increases customer satisfaction, and have applied my learnings in my subsequent work.
I also love technical mentorship. Not only have I coached the junior members on all the teams I've been on, but I also chaired an internal committee at my current company with the express purpose of facilitating knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
I am experienced in working with remote teams, and comfortable to adjust my working hours to accommodate my team's needs. My current workplace has a strong culture of biasing for action and getting things done, which to my understanding is also an attitude that is valued at The Browser Company. 

I am thrilled for the opportunity to apply for this role, and hope I might be able to contribute my skills to the work and vision of your organization. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you!

Sincerely,

Phlippie Bosman
