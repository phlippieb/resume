# Phlippie Bosman's Resume

This repository contains source files for generating my résumé. The following files play the following roles:

- [resume.md](resume.md) is the source containing the structure and content of the actual résumé
- [make-pdf.sh](make-pdf.sh) is a script that generates a PDF version of the résumé, styled according to `resume.css`, using the `pandoc` command
- [resume.css](resume.css) is used to style the PDF generated by `make-pdf.sh`

## Install

This repo requires you to install some dependencies.

Markdown is consumed and processed by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html), which can be installed on Mac by `brew install pandoc`.

You then need an additional engine to create the PDF files. make-pdf.sh has commented code to make use of either electron-pdf, pagesjs, or wkhtmltopdf. You only need one of these:

- [electron-pdf](https://github.com/fraserxu/electron-pdf)
  - My preference, as it seems like a neater install
  - `npm install --global electron-pdf`
- [pages js](https://pagedjs.org)
  - Requires `puppeteer` and seemingly Chrome, so is a little heavier to install
  - `npm install --global pagedjs-cli pagedjs`
- [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf)
  - Produces the smallest PDF files, but doesn't handle custom fonts correctly, so only usable with the default sans-serif font
  - `brew install wkhtmltopdf`

Make sure your tool of choice is installed, then uncomment the appropriate section in make-pdf.sh.

## Workflow

The `main` branch contains my complete résumé. Tailored versions for specific applications are "released" by cutting a release branch, editing the content in `resume.md`, and generating a PDF.

## Web version

A GitHub Pages-hosted version of the resume is available at [phlippieb.github.io/resume](https://phlippieb.github.io/resume). It is not currently styled as well as the generated PDFs; this is still a work in progress.
