# Phlippie Bosman's Resume

This repository contains source files for generating my resume. I did a write-up about [running a resume like a software project](https://phlippieb.bearblog.dev/the-resume-as-a-software-micro-project/) on my blog.

## Install

This repo requires you to install some dependencies.

#### Pandoc

Markdown is consumed and processed by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html), which can be installed on Mac by `brew install pandoc`.

#### PDF engine

You then need an additional engine to create the PDF files. The make scripts in `.scripts/` contain commented code to make use of either electron-pdf, pagesjs, or wkhtmltopdf. You only need one of these:

- [electron-pdf](https://github.com/fraserxu/electron-pdf)
  - My preference, as it seems like a neater install
  - `npm install --global electron-pdf`
- [pages js](https://pagedjs.org)
  - Requires `puppeteer` and seemingly Chrome, so is a little heavier to install
  - `npm install --global pagedjs-cli pagedjs`
- [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf)
  - Produces the smallest PDF files, but doesn't handle custom fonts correctly, so only usable with the default sans-serif font
  - `brew install wkhtmltopdf`

Make sure your tool of choice is installed, then uncomment the appropriate section in make-pdf.sh.

#### Inter font

The resume uses the Inter font. [Get it here](https://rsms.me/inter/#).

## Usage

To work on the resume: edit `resume.md` to edit the content of the resume, and edit `resume.css` to change the style of the produced PDF or HTML. Run `make pdf` to generate a PDF format resume artifact. Run `make html` to generate a web page format, as it will be displayed on Github Pages (see Web Version below).

To work on the cover letter: edit `cover-letter.md` to edit the content of the cover letter, and edit `cover-letter.css` to change the style of the produced PDF. Run `make cover-letter` to generate a PDF format cover letter.

Run `make clean` to remove all HTML and PDF files generated by any commands. This will clear **all** files matching .pdf and .html, which are also ignored by git, so take care not to lose anything important.

## Workflow

The `main` branch contains my complete résumé. Tailored versions for specific applications are "released" by cutting a release branch, editing the content in `resume.md`, and generating a PDF.

To release to GitHub Pages (see Web version), merge into the `gh-pages` branch.

### Spelling and grammar checking

Spelling and grammar can be checked locally. I currently use Gramma: https://caderek.github.io/gramma

Example usage: `gramma check resume.md`

## Web version

A GitHub Pages-hosted version of the resume is available at [phlippieb.github.io/resume](https://phlippieb.github.io/resume). It is responsive and supports dark mode.
